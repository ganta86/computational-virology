# Immune Profiling: Responses to EBV Peptide Antigens

## Overview
This dataset and analysis focus on profiling **immune responses** to several **peptide antigens** of **Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)**. The study explores the diversity and strength of immune responses, helping to identify key antigens that may play a role in infection control or vaccine development.

The data were collected using advanced immune profiling techniques, allowing for detailed characterization of the immune system's response to EBV peptide antigens.

## Objectives
1. Characterize **immune responses** to multiple EBV peptide antigens.
2. Identify **key antigens** that elicit strong immune responses.
3. Provide insights into potential **targets for vaccine development**.

---

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains comprehensive immune response profiles, including:
- **Participant Information**: Metadata about the individuals whose responses were profiled.
- **Peptide Antigen Data**: Immune responses to a library of EBV peptide antigens.
- **Response Metrics**: Quantitative measures of immune activity (e.g., cytokine levels, T-cell activation).

### Directory Structure
- `data/`: Raw and processed immune profiling datasets.
- `scripts/`: Analysis scripts to process, visualize, and interpret the data.
- `results/`: Figures, processed data, and key findings.

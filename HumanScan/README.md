# HumanScan: Identification of Autoantibodies in Humans

## Overview
This dataset and analysis focus on identifying **autoantibodies** in humans. The study aims to explore the presence and patterns of autoantibodies in different conditions, providing insights into their potential role in health and disease.

The data were generated using **HumanScan**, a high-throughput method for detecting and characterizing autoantibodies.

---

## Objectives
1. Identify and catalog **autoantibodies** present in human samples.
2. Explore the potential association of autoantibodies with specific conditions.
3. Provide a resource for further study of autoantibody profiles.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains results from autoantibody profiling in human samples. It includes:
- **Participant Information**: Metadata about the individuals whose samples were analyzed.
- **Autoantibody Data**: Comprehensive profiles of autoantibody presence and reactivity.
- **Condition-Specific Data**: Associations between autoantibodies and various conditions.

### Directory Structure
- `data/`: Raw and processed HumanScan datasets.
- `scripts/`: Analysis scripts to process and visualize the data.
- `results/`: Figures, processed data, and key findings.
